Dear Mr. Victor,

Thank you for your reply.
Ok noted. Is Mr. Guo the same guy who made 
the purchase in your last transaction?
Perhaps I will notify my colleauge who is 
in charge of the local sales business 
about your inquiry.
Noted with the 2 needle 1/4” gauge set.

Regarding the velcro attaching machine, 
our S-326G is a better option for you.
You can buy a separate velcro cutting machine 
if you don’t have one yet.

And then place the velcro manually on the S-326G.
With the addition of Auto Slide Presser Foot 
Because auto slide foot slide to the side, 
giving the operator a more convenient way 
to place the velcro. 
Device, it will be much better and safer 
for the worker to operate the machine.
The operator hand does not need to hold 
down the velcro during sewing, because 
On the other hand, while the auto flip foot 
can do the job fine, however it stays there 
a few centimeters above the plate making 
the velcro placement is less convenient.
the auto slide presser foot will hold 
the velcro down steadily. Once the sewing 
is done, this foot will slide to the side 
for the operator to prepare the next sewing.
This is the main benefit having the auto slide 
foot compared to the auto flip foot.
