
Regarding the velcro attaching machine, 
our S-326G is a better option for you.
You can buy a separate velcro cutting machine 
if you don’t have one yet.

And then place the velcro manually on the S-326G.
With the addition of Auto Slide Presser Foot 
Device, it will be much better and safer 
for the worker to operate the machine.
The operator hand does not need to hold 
down the velcro during sewing, because 
the auto slide presser foot will hold 
the velcro down steadily. Once the sewing 
is done, this foot will slide to the side 
for the operator to prepare the next sewing.
This is the main benefit having the auto slide 
foot compared to the auto flip foot.
